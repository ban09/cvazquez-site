Something that I have done over and over at work and when working on hobby projects is checking satellite visibility. There are many usefull websites already providing that. For the case of GNSS there is the well known https://www.gnssplanning.com/, which allows to check satellite visibility at a location and even more advanced things like TEC in an easy way.

When some extra constraints are needed and the analysis has to be done for a set of dates, this kind of web pages become tedious so some automation is needed. Fortunately on python there is the excelent [SkyField](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/) library.
